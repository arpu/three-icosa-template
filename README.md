# HTML three-tiltloader | Three.js WebXR Template

This template is based on the ThreeJS WebXR [template](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates/html-three-webxr-template) for hicetnunc, with the minimal modifications to add [three-tiltloader](https://github.com/icosa-gallery/three-tiltloader). 

At a minimum, the template provided should only need your model, named `model.glb`, adding to this folder to work correctly.
